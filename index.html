            <h3>Polygons from Line Segments</h3>
                <p>This is a demonstration/test of a technique for taking a set of line segments and finding all of the polygons that
    the intersections generate.  Click on the canvas to add line segments.  The drawing is done using p5.js.The summary of the algorithm is:</p>
                    <h3>The algorithm</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Find all intersections between line segments</li>
                <li>From the set of intersections, identify a nearest neighbor in each direction</li>
                <li>Generate a graph where each node is an intersection-point with a connection to that intersection-point's nearest neighbors
                <li>Use a depth-first search to find the shortest paths from each node back to itself without backtracking.  These
                    paths should make up the minimal cycles in the graph which correspond to the polygons made by the line segments.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Problems/Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We are treating each intersection-point as unique.  If your system has more than two lines intersecting
                    on the same point, part of this process might not work.  If it doesn't, it shouldn't be too hard to allow
                    for overlapping intersection points in the geometry layer but still treat them as separate nodes in the graph
                    layer.  I think this should be fine but I haven't thought hard about it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our technique misses some polygons.  This is explained in slightly-more-detail in a comment in graph.js 
                    (in the findMinimumCycles() function), along with some attempts to fix the problem and an untested idea.  
                </li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Code</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/wmacfarl/polygonsFromSegments">
              https://github.com/wmacfarl/polygonsFromSegments</a></li>
            <li>index.html + sketch.js:  demonstration page for interactive construction of segments+polygons</li>
            <li>polygonFinder.js: contains functions for finding polygons.  depends on lineSegement.js, point.js, intersection.js, and graph.js</li>
            <li>lineSegment.js, point.js, intersection.js: Geometry classes with some basic utility functions.</li>
            <li>graph.js: Class for creating and analyzing graphs -- contains depth-first-search, shortest path code, etc</li>
          </ul>
          
           <p>In general, I think that polygonFinder.js should have all *geometric* data -- everything referencing coordinates, points, or lines.  graph.js should 
             care only about nodes and connections.  *This is not currently true.*</p>
            <p>At the moment graph.js nodes are associated with points and these associations are used to
            help us build the graph.  This could probably be generalized into just being an association with a generic ID-object instead of a 
            point which would let us use the code in non-geometric domains.</p>
